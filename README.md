# ðŸŽ¬ ET Newsletter

I built this project to generate and send a curated newsletter featuring top-rated movies and TV shows to me and my friends. It uses the TMDB API to fetch content, scrapes Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes for review scores, and uses SendGrid to distribute the formatted HTML newsletter.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Content Curation**: Fetches top movies and TV shows from TMDB based on a configurable time window and popularity.
- **Review Aggregation**: Scrapes Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes to gather critic and audience scores for featured content.
- **Dynamic Newsletter Generation**: Generates a dynamic and responsive HTML newsletter using Jinja2 templates.
- **Email Compatibility**: Inlines CSS into the HTML to ensure consistent rendering across various email clients using `premailer`.
- **Email Distribution**: Sends the generated newsletter to a list of subscribers via SendGrid.
- **Test Mode**: Includes a convenient test mode for sending newsletters to a single recipient for review before a full send.
